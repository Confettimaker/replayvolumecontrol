# The aim of this project is to create a seemless volume control extension for Pokemon Showdown replays.

The current state of this project is extremely simple. I am no front end developer. Please help to make it look nice and operate better.
Due to the fact that this is an unofficial add-on, you may have to repeat the installation process upon browser restart.
